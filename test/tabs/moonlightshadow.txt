    Am                 F
The last that ever she saw him

G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

   Am                    F
He passed on worried and warning

G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.

C                    G
Lost in a river last Saturday night

Am   F          G
Far away on the other side.

       C                         G
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight

        Am            F           G
And she couldn't find how to push through

    Am                        F
The trees that whisper in the evening

G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

       Am                 F
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving

G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

C                 G
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun

Am   F          G
Far away on the other side.

       C                   G
He was shot six times by a man on the run

        Am            F           G
And she couldn't find how to push through


G
I stay I pray

      C      F      G
I see you in heaven far away


G
I stay I pray

      C      F      G
I see you in heaven far away

Am             F
Four am in the morning

G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

  Am                  F
I watched your vision forming

G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

C                   G
Star was light in a silvery night

Am   F          G
Far away on the other side

         C               G
Will you come to talk to me this night

        Am            F           G
But she couldn't find how to push through


G
I stay I pray

      C      F      G
I see you in heaven far away


G
I stay I pray

      C      F      G
I see you in heaven far away

Far away on the other side.


C                         G                 Am       F      G
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five

C                           G
The night was heavy but the air was alive

    Am            F           G
She couldn't find how to push through


Am      F     G                 C         G
              Carried away by a moonlight shadow

Am      F     G                 C         G
              Carried away by a moonlight shadow

C       G     Am   F          G
              Far away on the other side.
