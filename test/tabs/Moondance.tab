Here you go...
The chords are very easy.  In part-A, I use my thumb on the low-E string 
to do some cool stuff with the bass (strictly optional).  I tried to show 
the syncopation in the tab below.  Hope you enjoy it.

VERSE 1:
            Am7       Bm7         Am7       Bm7
well it's a marvelous night for a moondance with the 

Am7        Bm7          Am7      Bm7
stars up a-bove in your eyes

      Am7      Bm7           Am7     Bm7
a fan-tabulous night to make romance 'neath the 

Am7      Bm7     Am7      Bm7
color of october skies


        Am7           Bm7       Am7     Bm7
all the leaves on the trees are falling to the 

Am7           Bm7          Am7      Bm7
sounds of the breezes that blow


        Am7       Bm7          Am7     Bm7
and i'm trying to place to the calling of the 

Am7               Bm7           Am7     
heartstrings that play soft and low


               Dm7 Dm7    Am7
and every time          I touch you 

         Dm7 Dm7             Am7
you just          tremble in-side

           Dm7 Dm7      Am7
and I know          how much you want me 

     Dm7 Dm7 Dm7              E7 E7 E7    
that             I cant hide




    Am7    Bm7      Am7       Bm7
can I just have one more moon-dance with 

Am7    Bm7       Am7     Bm7
you           my love


    Am7    Bm7       Am7     Bm7
can I just make some more ro-mance with 

Am7    Bm7       Am7   E7
you           my love



VERSE 2:

well I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait til the morning has come

and I know that the time will be just right
and straight into my arms you will come

when you come my heart will be waiting 
to be sure that you're never alone

there and then all my dreams will come true dear
there and then I will make you my own

you know the night's magic seems to 
whisper and hush  and all the 

soft moonlight seems to shine
on your blush


can I just have one more moondance with you
my love

can I just make some more romance with you
my love
