 Dm7                   C
Rowers gliding on the river

  Dm7                          G
Canadian geese crap along the bank

 Dm7                               C     C/B  Am
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver

      F        C                  G
The chain is wrapped around the crank


       Dm7                          C
Old ladies, who must be doggie training

 Dm7                                      G
Walking, trowing balls, chasing all the sheep

          Dm7                                C      C/B  Am
While the farmer stands around and he's complaining

         F        C             G
His mad cows are being put to sleep

D|0-2-3 F     C            G           Am        G

I'm  a  Pices Fish and the river runs through my soul


 Dm7                     C
Smoke signals from the brewery

      Dm7                               G
Like someone in there found the latest pope

             Dm7                              C    C/B  Am
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury

            F                   C              G
While the church bell ringer's tangled in his rope


    Dm7                   C

But there's a temple on an island

  Dm7                                  G
I think of all the gods and what they feel

             Dm7                       C       C/B  Am
You can only find them in the deepest silence

          F      C             G
I got to get out of this big wheel


D|0-2-3 F     C            G           Am        G
I'm a Pices Fish and the river runs through my soul

I'm a Pices Fish and the river runs through my soul

                G                                     C
And I'll be swimming until  I  can   find   those  waters

G                                     C
That, the one unbounded ocean of bliss

G                                                      C
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters

G                                     C
But still an easy thing for us to miss


 Dm7                            C
Blades go skimming through the water

           Dm7                               G
I hear the coxon shouting his instructions about

           Dm7                        C     C/B  Am
With this crew oh, it could be a tall order

         F       C                        G
Have we time to sort all of these things out?


    Dm7                           C

Sometimes my life it feels like  fiction


            Dm7                       C
Some of the days it's really quite serene

              Dm7                       C        C/B  Am
I'm a living proof of all life's contradictions

             F              C                  G
One half is going where the other half's just been


D|0-2-3 F     C            G           Am        G
I'm a Pices Fish and the river runs through my soul
