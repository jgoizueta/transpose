Verse 1:
A
How's the wife with the husband
C#m
Who doesn't understand
Bm
Why she starts to cry each morning
Dm
And the coldness in her hands
A
And the cold cold ballerina
C#m
Whose thoughts of love and life
Bm
Have split her down the middle
Dm
Till she's cracked like walked on ice
A
And the prince of fifteen years
C#m
With no roof over his life
Bm
Cause his parents don't know of his meaning
Dm
Or his needle and his knife


Chorus:
A            C#m    E
And how's the family
A        C#m    E
How's the family


Verse 2:
A
How's the tired widowed grandmother
C#m
Who has lost half of her life
Bm
And the overweight aunt from nowhere
Dm
Who can cook but is no wife
A
And she thinks its so disgusting
C#m
About the movies that are made
Bm
And she sleeps with just a pillow
Dm
And a memory that fades
A
Of a husband who had tried
C#m
To do everything so right
Bm
Till his heart screamed and stopped beating
Dm
As he made love one last night

Chorus
A             C#m    E
And how's the family
A        C#m     E
How's the family

Verse 3:
A
How's the boy and the girl
C#m
And the lives that lie ahead
Bm
And from two they join as one
Dm
They say we'll love till we are dead
A
And the babies come and grow
C#m
And the mothers laugh and cry
Bm
And the men know who they're working for
Dm
And what's more they know why
A
Cause its happy to be said
C#m
When tears can laugh at pain
Bm
And if you love the thought of love
Dm
Your birth will never end

Chorus
A              C#m    E
And how's the family
A         C#m     E
How's the family
